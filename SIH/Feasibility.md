### Feasibility

1.Transparency in Supply Chain

• Blockchain ensures every step from herb collection to final formulation is recorded and cannot be tampered with.

2.Geo-Tagging Integration

• GPS-enabled devices or mobile apps can easily capture the collection location of herbs for authenticity.

3.Consumer Trust

• End-users can scan QR codes on Ayurvedic products to verify origin, boosting confidence in product quality.

4.Regulatory Compliance

• Provides verifiable data for AYUSH and export regulations, improving standardization and certification.

5.Farmer Empowerment

•Farmers/wild collectors get recognition and fair value since their contribution is permanently logged.

6.Scalability of Technology

• Blockchain platforms (like Hyperledger, Ethereum) can scale for multiple stakeholders (farmers, labs, manufacturers).




###Disability (Challenges/Limitations)

1.High Implementation Cost

• Initial setup of blockchain, IoT devices, and geo-tagging infrastructure can be expensive.

2.Technical Complexity

• Farmers and collectors may struggle to adopt blockchain and GPS tools without proper training.

3.Connectivity Issues

•Rural areas may face poor internet access, making real-time geo-tagging difficult.

4.Data Privacy Concerns

•Sensitive location and farmer data stored on blockchain might raise privacy and security issues.

5.Interoperability Problems

•Integrating blockchain with existing supply chain systems and government platforms may be challenging.

6.Maintenance & Updates

•Continuous monitoring, updates, and support are required, which small-scale farmers may not afford.
